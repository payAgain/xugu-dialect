# hibernate-test Agent Entry

## Tool-agnostic note
This file is the project operating guide for **any** coding agent. Role files live in `agents/`. Procedures live in `skills/`. Do not require IDE-specific skill installation.

## Human Gate vs workers
The user-facing chat is the **Human Gate** only: Clarify/Scope Q&A, approve **Build scope** (which Phases), review SHAs, authorize Ship.  
It must **not** implement, decide Phase parallel/同步, or self-orchestrate. Spawn an **orchestrator** per Build, then workers. Naming: framework `protocol/references/glossary.md`.

## First action on unclear goals
- **New product / first contact:** `skills/clarify.md` → product Intent Clarity PASS  
- **Next feature / version after init:** `skills/initiative.md` (scoped) — do **not** re-init the whole harness  
- Do not write business code until the matching PASS phrase is given

## Reading order
At session/batch start, follow `skills/start.md`:
1. `current-task.md`
2. `harness/session/session-state.json`
3. `harness/session/session-log.md`
4. `harness/initiatives/INDEX.md` + active `harness/initiatives/<id>/brief.md` (if any)
5. `harness/drafts/INTENT-CLARITY.md` (if product intent not yet PASS)
6. `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` (if present)
7. `DECISIONS/INDEX.md` and applicable ADRs
8. `contracts/<module>.contract.md` (if present)
9. `harness/ownership/OWNERSHIP.yaml` (if present)
10. `harness/tasks/<task>.md` (if present)
11. `docs/verification.md`, `docs/error-journal.md`, `docs/branching.md`
12. relevant `agents/<role>.md`

Output a Session Briefing before editing.

## Non-negotiables
- **Naming:** Clarify → Charter → Bootstrap → Scope → Plan → Build → Accept → Ship → Archive; IDs `I/P/B-00x` (`glossary.md`)
- **First init ≠ Scope.** Clarify/Charter/Bootstrap never ask hotfix|feature|major
- **Phases serial by default.** Never ask human about 并行/同步; orchestrator decides from dependencies
- **Phase + role_pipeline + acceptance_doc.** No anonymous “implement Task N” workers
- **Clarify before act** (product Clarify or scoped Scope)
- **Initiative loop** after Bootstrap: `skills/initiative.md`, not re-init
- **Every role (including orchestrator) = separate role instance**
- **Must-commit** on working branches; humans review SHAs
- **Ship gate:** `tag` / `push` / `release` / protected branch only
- **GitHub Flow:** no implementation on `main`/`master`
- Modify only ownership/Phase Packet allowed paths
- No completion claim without project verification evidence + observed affected behavior + commit SHA (when changes exist)
- `VERIFY INCOMPLETE` and `VERIFY FAIL` block Accept; only `VERIFY PASS` satisfies the configured command gate
- Reviewer is readonly; Full + risk≥8 code needs reviewer before commit
- Dangerous shells go through `python harness/scripts/safe_bash_guard.py -- "<command>"`

## Procedures
- `skills/clarify.md` — product Intent Clarity
- `skills/initiative.md` — next feature / major / hotfix
- `skills/start.md`
- `skills/plan.md`
- `skills/review.md`
- `skills/commit.md` — create commit after verify
- `skills/handoff.md`

## Real commands
- Build: `mvn -q -DskipTests package`
- Test: `mvn -q test`
- Project verification contract: `harness/verification.json`
- Project verification: `python harness/scripts/verify.py` (`PASS` only when every required check is configured and succeeds)
- Harness check: `python harness/scripts/harness_check.py`
- Branch check: `python harness/scripts/branch_check.py`
- Danger check: `python harness/scripts/safe_bash_guard.py -- "<command>"`

Harness level: `Standard`  
Framework version: see `.harness-version`
